Digital Hub for ham radio (DigiHub)

DigiHub is designed to be an alternative to the popular DigiPi.

DigiPi is and excellent implementation, but by nature has limitations, and is highly
recommended as a starting point for those setting out on the digital ham road and can be
found here: https://digipi.org

DigiHub, builds on the DigiPi platform and allows installation on any pre-installed, 
Linux distribution, the primary benefit being flexible configurability.  The installation
script has been built and tested on Debian based (bookworm and trixie) Linux distributions
meaning it can still be installed on Raspberry Pi OS (on a Pi Zero 2W, Pi 3, 4 or, 5)
