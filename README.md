Digital Hub for ham radio (DigiHub)

DigiHub is designed to be an alternative to the popular DigiPi.

DigiPi is an excellent implementation, but by nature has limitations. It is highly
recommended as a starting point for the less tech savvy or those setting out on the digital ham road.

DigiHub, builds on the DigiPi platform and allows installation on any pre-installed Linux distribution.

The primary benefit of DigiHub is it's flexibily and configurability. 

The installation script has been built and tested on Debian based (bookworm and trixie) Linux distributions
meaning it can still be installed on Raspberry Pi OS (Pi Zero 2W, 3, 4 or, 5 are recommended).

All software is open-source licensed and is freely available.
